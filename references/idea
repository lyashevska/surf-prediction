so the buoy observation is more or less just to validate the outcome I would say.. even better the rating from magic seaweed

so the idea would be, to get some variables from weather and swell and see if we can predict the rating

https://magicseaweed.com/developer/forecast-api

the rating is a number

so if you get variables like, wind direction, swell direction, etc maybe you can predict the rating

but there are some models used to do the forecasting, prediction, SWAN for example
